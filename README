This is a little python script that will check rss feeds and download torrents from them automatically. Just put it in your crontab to run, say, every five minutes. e.g. "*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/rss_torrents.py". It is primarily intended for use with transmission-daemon but could be modified to work with other torrent clients fairly easily.

Mostly this was just for fun; I could probably switched to a different torrent client that had support for rss with less difficulty.

This is also rather fragile, and will probably break in any number of cases. i.e. if the rss feed is empty, if some folders don't exist, or if you're using a different version of python.

Config is done in rss_torrents.py.
- TORRENT_DIR defaults to ~/.cache/torrentfiles/ and contains downloaded .torrent files. It may be cleaned out at any time by the user.
- FEED_FILE defaults to ~/.local/rss_torrents/feeds.csv and contains pairs of (rss feed url, timestamp when last checked). It should not be hand-edited.
- NEW_FEEDS defaults to ~/.local/rss_torrents/new.txt and contains new rss feeds you want to track, one per line. You should edit this just by doing `echo "http://example.org/rss" >> ~/.local/rss_torrents/new.txt`. Once they are added to the feed, old lines will be removed.
- SEED_RATIO defaults to 50 and is fairly obvious what it means. I wonder what happens if you set it to 0. That would be rather rude, so I haven't tried.
